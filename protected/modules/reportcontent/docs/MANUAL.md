# Manual

Once installed and activated, the module becomes available for the entire network. It does not have to be additionally activated in each space.

## Spaces

The module adds a new view showing content users have reported at `Space -> Settings -> Reported Content`.

Space Administrators & Moderators are able to access said view to address the reports.

## Admins

Administrators of the network are able to access all reports via `Administration -> Reported Content`.

- Admins can access all reports via 'Administration -> Reported Content'
- Admins can adapt the module configuration
- If a report is against a space admin/mod, it will only be shown to Super Admins (members of the default HumHub Admin group)

## Profanity Filter

Administrators with the right to modify the module configuration can also add new terms to the Profanity filter.

- Undesired terms can be added separated by commas
- Content containing a term from the list, will automatically be reported by the module
- Content creation can also be blocked automatically if a undesired term is used
