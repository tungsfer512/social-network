# Twitter Sign-In

Using this module, users can directly log in or register with their Twitter credentials at this HumHub installation. 
A new button "Twitter" will appear on the login page.

## Configuration

Please follow the [Twitter instructions](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/authentication/guides/log-in-with-twitter) to create the required ` OAuth client ID` credentials.

Once you have the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** created there, the values must then be entered in the module configuration at: `Administration -> Modules -> Twitter Auth -> Settings`. 
This page also displays the `Authorized redirect URI`, which must be inserted in Twitter in the corresponding field.
You should also apply for Elevated API access level. Learn more [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api#v2-access-levels).
