Work around the problem of queued jobs executed by cron on managed shared servers that can't be set to run every minute.


## Usage

Once the module is installed, go to `Administration -> Modules -> Cron Daemon -> Configure`.


## Pricing

This module is free, but is the result of a lot of work for the design and maintenance over time.
