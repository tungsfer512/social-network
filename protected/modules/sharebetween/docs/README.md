## Share Between

This module enables users to share content seamlessly between different Spaces of a network. 

It is designed to integrate seamlessly into the software, and it allows users to share various types of content such as text, images, audio, and video files. Users can easily select the content they wish to share and specify the destination Space or Spaces where the content should be shared.

One of the key benefits of the “Share between” module is that it eliminates the need for users to duplicate content across different Spaces, thereby saving time and reducing the risk of errors. It also allows users to collaborate more effectively by facilitating seamless sharing of content across different teams or departments within an organization.
