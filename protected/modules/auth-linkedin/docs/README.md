# LinkedIn Sign-In

Using this module, users can directly log in or register with their LinkedIn credentials at this HumHub installation. 
A new button "LinkedIn" will appear on the login page.

## Configuration

Please follow the [LinkedIn instructions](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/5070/log-in-with-linkedin-credentials?lang=en) to create the required ` OAuth client ID` credentials.

Once you have the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** created there, the values must then be entered in the module configuration at: `Administration -> Modules -> LinkedIn Auth -> Settings`. 
This page also displays the `Authorized redirect URI`, which must be inserted in LinkedIn in the corresponding field.
