## Setup
- Enable the module via `ACP --> Modules --> Modules List`
- Go to your [Google AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/) account for the `data-ad-client`
- Once you've gotten the Ad tab unlocked create one which will give you a code snippet with your `data-ad-slot`
- Place both your `client` & `slot` into the AdSense module configuration fields and save.
